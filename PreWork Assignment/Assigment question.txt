 Dear Learner,

 

As we have completed the Prework module, We are releasing the below assessment for practice purposes. Kindly complete the assessment and push the codes in Github Public repository. Submit the Github URL in Olympus.

 

Note: This Practice assessment is not considered for Course grading and it will not be evaluated. The Objective of this practice assessment is to make you understand how the assessment submission works in Github and Olympus. We will release the solution on 23rd Aug 2022.

 

Question:

Write a program that performs multiple operations:

 

Check for palindrome number
Prints the pattern of stars in decreasing order based on the input
Check whether the input number is a prime number
Print Fibonacci series of size n with first two numbers as 0, 1
 

Using Switch case and do-While loop provide all the above functionality, such that the user can select the functions that he/she needs to perform and exit the program based on the input.

 

Once you have completed the assignment upload the file in Github and paste the URL here in the "Submit Assignment Section"

Function Explanations in Brief: 

1) Palindrome number:

 The numbers which give the same value when reversed are called palindrome numbers.

Example: 121, 12321, 512215, etc.,

 

2)Pattern of stars: 

 

Based on the input integer, the levels in the pattern and the number of stars in each level are decided. At every level, the number of stars is 1 less than the previous level.

 

Example: If the input number is 4, then the output will be

****

***

**

*

 

 if input no is 5, then the output will be

*****

****

***

**

*




If input no is 2, then the output will be

 

**

*

 

3) Prime number: 

 

The numbers which are only divisible by 1 & themselves are called prime numbers. 

(Or) 

The numbers which have factors as 1 and themselves are called prime numbers.

 

Example_1: If the input number is 23

Factors of 23 are 1, 23, and other than 1 it  is divisible by 23 only

Hence the number is prime.

 

Example_2: If the input number is 22

Factors of 22 are 1,2, 11, 22 and are divisible by 2 and 11.

Hence the number is not a prime number.

 

 4)Fibonacci series: 

The series of numbers whose next number is the sum of its previous two numbers is called the Fibonacci series.

Example_1: If the input number is 5,

The Fibonacci series  is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 (by default first two numbers are 0,1 (hardcoded), and we need to calculate the other nos in series)

 

Example_2: If the input number is 7

The Fibonacci series is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 , 8

 

Exit:

The program should ask the user to choose the task they want to perform after executing a task, till choice 0 is entered to exit the program.

           int first = 0, second = 1;

                int choice;

                Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

do {

System.out.println("Enter your choice from below list.\n" + "1. Find palindrome of number.\n"

+ "2. Print Pattern for a given no.\n" + "3. Check whether the no is a  prime number.\n"

+ "4. Print Fibonacci series.\n" + "--> Enter 0 to Exit.\n");

System.out.println();

 

choice = sc.nextInt();
